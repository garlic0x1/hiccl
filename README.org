#+title: Readme

Hiccup HTML generator for Common Lisp

* Purpose
Spinneret is great but having to use macros to compose elements is less intuitive than simply having a function to render sexprs into html

* Usage
- Symbols are raw (you can write literal HTML between `|` symbols)
- Strings are sanitized
- Lists are HTML nodes
#+begin_src lisp :exports both
(render
 `(div :hi "world"
    (:span "tag can be symbol")
    "no </\"xss\"> allowed"
    |symbols <are> "raw" </are>|
    (a :href "lOOOool")))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: <div hi="world">
: <span>
: tag can be symbol
: </span>
: no &lt;/&quot;xss&quot;&gt; allowed
: symbols <are> "raw" </are>
: <a href="lOOOool">
: </a>
: </div>
